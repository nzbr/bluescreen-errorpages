# BlueScreen-Errorpages

Error pages for a webserver that look like a Windows 9x BSOD  
They are developed for and currently in use at [https://nzbr.de](https://nzbr.de)

`./build.py` may be used to create the actual html-files for the webserver

If you consider using these, you may want to remove the `nzbr.de` branding from just about everywhere
